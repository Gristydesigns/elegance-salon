running since 2011. The owner had previously commissioned a designer to develop a website; this site no longer fits the business aspirations. I wanted this site to be interactive with Elegance’s social media sites and overall marketing strategy. The customer experience is important and needs to be quick and easy to use. The site needs to offer customers to purchase products and make online appointments. ","•\tMy aim is to develop a website with my new knowledge, skills and understanding yet also have a distinct client in mind who has desires for the site. As a developer it is important to gain the skill of ensuring we understand clients’ needs and desires and then support them in seeing new opportunities to better their ideas to come out with a well-functioning site. Working with others in developing ideas has been something I am well averse to yet in this in this environment where I am totally out of my comfort zone was challenging yet very informative personally.","My page","•\tSix-page website enables Elegance to take more advertising space on google; in-conjunction with raising their presence online. This is part of the market strategy and working with ‘google my business’.","•\tFor my first milestone project I wanted to experiment with all the new knowledge I have gained through the Full Stack course. I have used HTML and Bootstrap to design the layout of the website. This is to provide functionality and a responsive design which sits in an HTML shell with added elements of CSS to add styling. When talking with the owner and the customers to their opinion on the development of the site has been the springboard to the website. The customer can book appointments, call the salon and buy products. The products list is an affiliate link for the owner. This generated income she has previously not used and is not on other website.","Contents","1. UX","•\tProject Design","•\tUser Objects","•\tDevelopers Objects","•\tUser Stories","•\tWireframes","•\tDeployment","•\tTesting","•\tAcknowledgements","2. Site Features","3. Technologies Used","4. Testing","5. Deployment","6. Acknowledgements","7. Disclaimer","Project Design","•\tThe website has been designed around the branding of the salon; they are in the process of developing this within their marketing strategy and the website is the centre of the launch. Keeping the website crisp and clean with call for action links has been the underpinning intention; key to the market strategy. The images have also been an important consideration as the salon has developed their knowledge and techniques and have not shared this formally; though imagery and showing off!","Design","•\tMy initial wireframe looked at a jumbotron which would be fixed at the top on all pages; yet as design started to develop this was changed. There is still at top call for action statement and button. As a developer my intentions were to show the knowledge and experience the salon can offer to customers and then with ease to contact them; through an action button. The salon has a good conversion rate, so the website is part of the traffic flow for the salon to increase clients.","Colours","•\tThe colour scheme was chosen by the owner yet there was some influence when I used the colour palette to have shades that complimented each other. We looked at 10 different colour palettes.","•\tOriginally a consideration was for a full background images; this was changed as what is needed is for the images to speak for themselves and have the impact they deserve.","Images","•\tThe salon is updating their images in-line with their new skills and abilities. So the websites needs to showcase these. Each image is there to inspire and show off the professionalism of the salon. As stated by their new strapline ’Setting the trend’; this has already been tested out as other salons are following Elegance strategies. Imagery is important to engage clients on site and so I need to as a developer place these well to have the wow factor, so they stay on site until they access the service.","Styling","•\tHaving researched other clean, crisps sites; demonstrated having consistency across all pages builds trust and knowledge for user to enable them to surf further on the site as it engages them. Designers appreciate that there is data that says it is harder to engage users on your sit year by year we flick less; therefore, it is paramount users have an experience they are enjoying; gaining what they require swiftly.","•\tLocation information has been offered through a link; maps can be distracting on a page.","•\tThe hover option is on all buttons for ease for the user knowing where they are on the site. Hight-light of text has been offered to draw their focus subtly to the full page. Links to FaceBook, Instagram are working to enable them to link further if required.","•\tThe home page has been designed so that when the salon develops Blogs on their ‘Google My Business’ and this can be linked through offering consistency and branding/promotion.","Fonts","•\tAs a developer I want to find text that would work across browsers. I used Google fonts to find a font that would complement their logo which is in baldessare font. The salon is presently updating so they will have an image file for their logo, and this will need to be added at a later date.","•\tFonts and colour of the website I tested out the with owner and customer group. ","UX","•\tInitially I drew my wireframe on paper.  I worked out the template I wanted across all the pages. Then developed the ideas for the feature section, as a developer I want each section to be clear, informative and to draw viewer further to other parts of the site. As a developer I wanted the action buttons to be clear and user friendly so that they looked part of the page, subtle yet obvious.","•\tI detailed my ideas and then reflected on these prior to using balsamiq to have a digital version. I would use adobe XD next time as I feel this gives a better user experience for clients.","•\tI already had some images as I have developed their ‘google my business’ site; in consideration for other projects I will be using imgbb site. ","•\tI also knew they were entering a competition so would have further images available yet were unsure what they would be like. i went on codrops for inspiration.","Project Goals","•\tThe six pages have been designed to offer the user the opportunity to gain information with ease and speed. The website has not been developed for the user to have to go through every page unless they wish to do so.  As a developer I wanted to offer the viewer just to go to the page they required and have the given information, links available without searching. I had considered putting the telephone number and address in the footer, yet this looked very busy.","•\tPlacing information on the site where a user knows from prior experience on using the web was important, so it felt familiar with the user.","User Objects","•\tThe website has been designed as part of a marketing strategy for the salon to gain new customers also, to offer customers to buy products. ","•\tFor customers unsure what they want to achieve to have the opportunity to look at what the salon offers; then gain opportunity for consultation.","What I wanted the user to gain:","•\tRecognise the salon, especially staff members","•\tConsultation opportunity with an expert","•\tInspired to feeling great and gain new ideas","•\tProduct information, links to further information on products","•\tImages to promote salon/brand","•\tOpportunity to buy products","“Setting the Trend”:","•\tThis strap line has been developed as part of the website. The development of Instagram engagement has had impact locally; other salons are following the salon strategies. As a developer it is important to offer the salon a new look/idea so that they can build upon their success and continually having Elegance at the top of their game visually. Ledbury is a small market town and it is important for the business have a proactive marketing strategy online to gaining new clients.","Developers Objectives","•\tThe layout to be clean and informative so that navigation is easy.","•\tCall to action to be subtle yet obvious.","•\tThe structure of the programming to have clear structure.","•\tThe layout is formatted in a way that the user can navigate around the site without frustration.","•\tThe layout page applications are HTML, CSS, bootstrap (which includes some JQuery script).","Future plans","•\tFuture plans would be adding FB likes links in the footer.","•\tTo add FB pixel so that through google analytics can provide further information on statistic on site; this will enable the marketing strategy to continually develop and transform the salon.

The owner had previously commissioned a designer to develop a website; this site no longer fits the business aspirations. I wanted this site to be interactive with Elegance’s social media sites and overall marketing strategy. The customer experience is important and needs to be quick and easy to use. The site needs to offer customers to purchase products and make online appointments. ","•\tMy aim is to develop a website with my new knowledge, skills and understanding yet also have a distinct client in mind who has desires for the site. As a developer it is important to gain the skill of ensuring we understand clients’ needs and desires and then support them in seeing new opportunities to better their ideas to come out with a well-functioning site. Working with others in developing ideas has been something I am well averse to yet in this in this environment where I am totally out of my comfort zone was challenging yet very informative personally.","My page","•\tSix-page website enables Elegance to take more advertising space on google; in-conjunction with raising their presence online. This is part of the market strategy and working with ‘google my business’.","•\tFor my first milestone project I wanted to experiment with all the new knowledge I have gained through the Full Stack course. I have used HTML and Bootstrap to design the layout of the website. This is to provide functionality and a responsive design which sits in an HTML shell with added elements of CSS to add styling. When talking with the owner and the customers to their opinion on the development of the site has been the springboard to the website. The customer can book appointments, call the salon and buy products. The products list is an affiliate link for the owner. This generated income she has previously not used and is not on other website.","Contents","1.

Testing","5. Deployment","6. Acknowledgements","7. Disclaimer","Project Design","•\tThe website has been designed around the branding of the salon; they are in the process of developing this within their marketing strategy and the website is the centre of the launch. Keeping the website crisp and clean with call for action links has been the underpinning intention; key to the market strategy. The images have also been an important consideration as the salon has developed their knowledge and techniques and have not shared this formally; though imagery and showing off!","Design","•\tMy initial wireframe looked at a jumbotron which would be fixed at the top on all pages; yet as design started to develop this was changed. There is still at top call for action statement and button. As a developer my intentions were to show the knowledge and experience the salon can offer to customers and then with ease to contact them; through an action button. The salon has a good conversion rate, so the website is part of the traffic flow for the salon to increase clients.","Colours","•\tThe colour scheme was chosen by the owner yet there was some influence when I used the colour palette to have shades that complimented each other. We looked at 10 different colour palettes.","•\tOriginally a consideration was for a full background images; this was changed as what is needed is for the images to speak for themselves and have the impact they deserve.","Images","•\tThe salon is updating their images in-line with their new skills and abilities. So, the websites needs to showcase these. Each image is there to inspire and show off the professionalism of the salon. As stated by their new strapline ’Setting the trend’; this has already been tested out as other salons are following Elegance strategies. Imagery is important to engage clients on site and so I need to as a developer place these well to have the wow factor, so they stay on site until they access the service.","Styling","•\tHaving researched other clean, crisps sites; demonstrated having consistency across all pages builds trust and knowledge for user to enable them to surf further on the site as it engages them. Designers appreciate that there is data that says it is harder to engage users on your sit year by year we flick less; therefore, it is paramount users have an experience they are enjoying; gaining what they require swiftly.","•\tLocation information has been offered through a link; maps can be distracting on a page.","•\tThe hover option is on all buttons for ease for the user knowing where they are on the site. Hight-light of text has been offered to draw their focus subtly to the full page. Links to FaceBook, Instagram are working to enable them to link further if required.","•\tThe home page has been designed so that when the salon develops Blogs on their ‘Google My Business’ and this can be linked through offering consistency and branding/promotion.","Fonts","•\tAs a developer I want to find text that would work across browsers. I used Google fonts to find a font that would complement their logo which is in baldessare font. The salon is presently updating so they will have an image file for their logo, and this will need to be added at a later date.","•\tFonts and colour of the website I tested out the with owner and customer group. ","UX","•\tInitially I drew my wireframe on paper.  I worked out the template I wanted across all the pages. Then developed the ideas for the feature section, as a developer I want each section to be clear, informative and to draw viewer further to other parts of the site. As a developer I wanted the action buttons to be clear and user friendly so that they looked part of the page, subtle yet obvious.","•\tI detailed my ideas and then reflected on these prior to using balsamiq to have a digital version. I would use adobe XD next time as I feel this gives a better user experience for clients.","•\tI already had some images as I have developed their ‘google my business’ site; in consideration for other projects I will be using imgbb.com site. ","•\tI also knew they were entering a competition so would have further images available yet were unsure what they would be like.","Project Goals","•\tThe six pages have been designed to offer the user the opportunity to gain information with ease and speed. The website has not been developed for the user to have to go through every page unless they wish to do so.  As a developer I wanted to offer the viewer just to go to the page they required and have the given information, links available without searching. I had considered putting the telephone number and address in the footer, yet this looked very busy.","•\tPlacing information on the site where a user knows from prior experience on using the web was important, so it felt familiar with the user.","User Objects","•\tThe website has been designed as part of a marketing strategy for the salon to gain new customers also, to offer customers to buy products. ","•\tFor customers unsure what they want to achieve to have the opportunity to look at what the salon offers; then gain opportunity for consultation.","What I wanted the user to gain:","•\tRecognise the salon, especially staff members","•\tConsultation opportunity with an expert","•\tInspired to feeling great and gain new ideas","•\tProduct information, links to further information on products","•\tImages to promote salon/brand","•\tOpportunity to buy products","“Setting the Trend”:","•\tThis strap line has been developed as part of the website. The development of Instagram engagement has had impact locally; other salons are following the salon strategies. As a developer it is important to offer the salon a new look/idea so that they can build upon their success and continually having Elegance at the top of their game visually. Ledbury is a small market town and it is important for the business have a proactive marketing strategy online to gaining new clients.","Developers Objectives","•\tThe layout to be clean and informative so that navigation is easy.","•\tCall to action to be subtle yet obvious.","•\tThe structure of the programming to have clear structure.","•\tThe layout is formatted in a way that the user can navigate around the site without frustration.","•\tThe layout page applications are HTML, CSS, bootstrap (which includes some JQuery script).","Future plans","•\tFuture plans would be adding FB likes links in the footer.","•\tTo add FB pixel so that through google analytics can provide further information on statistic on site; this will enable the marketing strategy to continually develop and transform the salon. The website is key to this.","•\tGoogle analytics is the next part of the market strategy and will inform future developments. Adding links to action buttons on site will inform future changes.","•\tSpeed of the website and images ass this important for user experience especially on mobiles.","User Stories","•\tThe main users are aged 18 and upwards however, their main client group is aged 40 plus:","1.\tThe client group wanted a light, bright website as they felt the other was dull and not inspiring.","2.\tThe six-page website has been used as a market strategy element to get as much advertising space as organically as the salon can.","For the user","1.\tI want them to find the site practical, informative and inspiring. The website must give a clear element of professionalism and trust.","2.\tSeparating the information on different pages allows the ease of information provided.","3.\tThe user can book appointments at any time of the day through the website.","4.\tThey can purchase products anytime of the day.","Original wireframe concepts","Wireframe1 - https://imgbbb.com/image/LTLS6N","Wireframe2 - https://imgbbb.com/image/LTL0W7","Wireframe3 - https://imgbbb.com/image/LTL3oO","•\tThe original wireframes had more images, and this could be a further development yet the images I had presently I have enclosed.
