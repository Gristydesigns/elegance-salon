<strong>ELEGANCE Hair Salon</strong>
ELEGANCE Hair Salon
•	Elegance Hair salon is based in the market town of Ledbury; it has been running since 2011. The owner had previously commissioned a designer to develop a website; this site no longer fits the business aspirations. I wanted this site to be interactive with Elegance’s social media sites and overall marketing strategy. The customer experience is important and needs to be quick and easy to use. The site needs to offer customers to purchase products and make online appointments. 
•	My aim is to develop a website with my new knowledge, skills and understanding yet also have a distinct client in mind who has desires for the site. As a developer it is important to gain the skill of ensuring we understand clients’ needs and desires and then support them in seeing new opportunities to better their ideas to come out with a well-functioning site. Working with others in developing ideas has been something I am well averse to yet in this in this environment where I am totally out of my comfort zone was challenging yet very informative personally.
My page
•	Six-page website enables Elegance to take more advertising space on google; in-conjunction with raising their presence online. This is part of the market strategy and working with ‘google my business’.
•	For my first milestone project I wanted to experiment with all the new knowledge I have gained through the Full Stack course. I have used HTML and Bootstrap to design the layout of the website. This is to provide functionality and a responsive design which sits in an HTML shell with added elements of CSS to add styling. When talking with the owner and the customers to their opinion on the development of the site has been the springboard to the website. The customer can book appointments, call the salon and buy products. The products list is an affiliate link for the owner. This generated income she has previously not used and is not on other website.

Project Design
•	The website has been designed around the branding of the salon; they are in the process of developing this within their marketing strategy and the website is the centre of the launch. Keeping the website crisp and clean with call for action links has been the underpinning intention; key to the market strategy. The images have also been an important consideration as the salon has developed their knowledge and techniques and have not shared this formally; though imagery and showing off!
Design
•	My initial wireframe looked at a jumbotron which would be fixed at the top on all pages; yet as design started to develop this was changed. There is still at top call for action statement and button. As a developer my intentions were to show the knowledge and experience the salon can offer to customers and then with ease to contact them; through an action button. The salon has a good conversion rate, so the website is part of the traffic flow for the salon to increase clients.
Colours
•	The colour scheme was chosen by the owner yet there was some influence when I used the colour palette to have shades that complimented each other. We looked at 10 different colour palettes.
•	Originally a consideration was for a full background images; this was changed as what is needed is for the images to speak for themselves and have the impact they deserve.
Images
•	The salon is updating their images in-line with their new skills and abilities. So the websites needs to showcase these. Each image is there to inspire and show off the professionalism of the salon. As stated by their new strapline ’Setting the trend’; this has already been tested out as other salons are following Elegance strategies. Imagery is important to engage clients on site and so I need to as a developer place these well to have the wow factor, so they stay on site until they access the service.
Styling
•	Having researched other clean, crisps sites; demonstrated having consistency across all pages builds trust and knowledge for user to enable them to surf further on the site as it engages them. Designers appreciate that there is data that says it is harder to engage users on your sit year by year we flick less; therefore, it is paramount users have an experience they are enjoying; gaining what they require swiftly.
•	Location information has been offered through a link; maps can be distracting on a page.
•	The hover option is on all buttons for ease for the user knowing where they are on the site. Hight-light of text has been offered to draw their focus subtly to the full page. Links to FaceBook, Instagram are working to enable them to link further if required.
•	The home page has been designed so that when the salon develops Blogs on their ‘Google My Business’ and this can be linked through offering consistency and branding/promotion.
Fonts
•	As a developer I want to find text that would work across browsers. I used Google fonts to find a font that would complement their logo which is in baldessare font. The salon is presently updating so they will have an image file for their logo, and this will need to be added at a later date.
•	Fonts and colour of the website I tested out the with owner and customer group. 
UX
•	Initially I drew my wireframe on paper.  I worked out the template I wanted across all the pages. Then developed the ideas for the feature section, as a developer I want each section to be clear, informative and to draw viewer further to other parts of the site. As a developer I wanted the action buttons to be clear and user friendly so that they looked part of the page, subtle yet obvious.
•	I detailed my ideas and then reflected on these prior to using balsamiq to have a digital version. I would use adobe XD next time as I feel this gives a better user experience for clients.
•	I already had some images as I have developed their ‘google my business’ site; in consideration for other projects I will be using imgbb site. 
•	I also knew they were entering a competition so would have further images available yet were unsure what they would be like. i went on codrops for inspiration.
Project Goals
•	The six pages have been designed to offer the user the opportunity to gain information with ease and speed. The website has not been developed for the user to have to go through every page unless they wish to do so.  As a developer I wanted to offer the viewer just to go to the page they required and have the given information, links available without searching. I had considered putting the telephone number and address in the footer, yet this looked very busy.
•	Placing information on the site where a user knows from prior experience on using the web was important, so it felt familiar with the user.
User Objects
•	The website has been designed as part of a marketing strategy for the salon to gain new customers also, to offer customers to buy products. 
•	For customers unsure what they want to achieve to have the opportunity to look at what the salon offers; then gain opportunity for consultation.
What I wanted the user to gain:
•	Recognise the salon, especially staff members
•	Consultation opportunity with an expert
•	Inspired to feeling great and gain new ideas
•	Product information, links to further information on products
•	Images to promote salon/brand
•	Opportunity to buy products
“Setting the Trend”:
•	This strap line has been developed as part of the website. The development of Instagram engagement has had impact locally; other salons are following the salon strategies. As a developer it is important to offer the salon a new look/idea so that they can build upon their success and continually having Elegance at the top of their game visually. Ledbury is a small market town and it is important for the business have a proactive marketing strategy online to gaining new clients.
Developers Objectives
•	The layout to be clean and informative so that navigation is easy.
•	Call to action to be subtle yet obvious.
•	The structure of the programming to have clear structure.
•	The layout is formatted in a way that the user can navigate around the site without frustration.
•	The layout page applications are HTML, CSS, bootstrap (which includes some JQuery script).
Future plans
•	Future plans would be adding FB likes links in the footer.
•	To add FB pixel so that through google analytics can provide further information on statistic on site; this will enable the marketing strategy to continually develop and transform the salon. The website is key to this.
•	Google analytics is the next part of the market strategy and will inform future developments. Adding links to action buttons on site will inform future changes.
•	Speed of the website and images ass this important for user experience especially on mobiles.
User Stories
•	The main users are aged 18 and upwards however, their main client group is aged 40 plus:
1.	The client group wanted a light, bright website as they felt the other was dull and not inspiring.
2.	The six-page website has been used as a market strategy element to get as much advertising space as organically as the salon can.
For the user
1.	I want them to find the site practical, informative and inspiring. The website must give a clear element of professionalism and trust.
2.	Separating the information on different pages allows the ease of information provided.
3.	The user can book appointments at any time of the day through the website.
4.	They can purchase products anytime of the day.
Original wireframe concepts

•	The original wireframes had more images, and this could be a further development yet the images I had presently I have enclosed. The brightness and professional crisp finish. Some images provided I have not put on as they are outdated.
•	I added the reviews page additionally; as they have had some awesome reviews, and this seemed an opportunity not to missed!
•	From the original sketches my designs have developed. Using balsamiq offered a digital version yet I would like to upgrade this next time as I feel it would enable me to grow my styles and add value to the project.
Intentions for the website are:
•	Google rating for the salon is important. The website has been built with 6 pages to maximise the advertising google space -(assisted through marketing strategy)
•	A user feels the website flows and that their user experience is positive.
•	The website gains new customer attention so they use the call to action buttons. This in the future can be monitored and measured through additional coding.
•	It enables the user to be inspired and to have instant trust to want to use the salon services.
•	Clean, crisp, light and most importantly rememberable!
•	I hope the site showcases what I have learnt already and that as I progress, I can return to develop site with new learning and understanding.
•	One intention was to have a form on the site for the client however, the salon does not have policies and procedures for this presently to hold personal data. Also reading on this topic; forms can be a barrier and click throughs are a better user experience.
Site Interactivity and Features
Technologies Used
This Project uses the following programming languages
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	Bootstap (JQuery)
•	Google Fonts
•	AWS Cloud 9

Bootstrap 4
•	Bootstrap was used to build a solid and yet simple structure which allowed the site to be responsive easily.
•	Google Fonts
•	Google was used for stylising the website fonts as it gave me a great selection to choose from.
Web Fundamentals
•	Affinity photo - I used this product to crop images
•	Microsoft Word - draft README file.
•	Web fundamentals – this was used for telephone number link. Adding meta data so modern mobiles browser automatically detect phone numbers and enable click to call. Mobile safari automatically converts phone numbers to links with the associated hyperlink style.
•	W3CSchools – I used for reference and guide
•	Coding All in One for Dummies – I used this text for reference and to gain a better understanding.
•	Web design index series – used for inspiration on designs
    CSS trick i used for coding
The goals for the website are:
•	To provide a website that met the salon owners’ objectives, provided a new and more updated website. That offered service user a good experience and more opportunity to engage online with the salon.
Ideal site visitors
This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:
The website visitors are predominately 40 plus in age and live in the radius of 30 miles. They generally live or work in the area. The salon has a reputation of retaining clients, so the focus was for new clients yet offering existing clients a service online too.
This website is:
The layout of site matches experience of using other sites e.g. where you expect info in footer etc…
It allows clients to book appointments online
Deployment
This project was developed using AWS Cloud9. The data is stored in git using the AWS Cloud9 platform.
The project was regularly pushed to GitHub repository https://gristydesigns.github.io/elegance-salon/ and published to GitHub pages using the GitHub settings.
Deployment to Github
I used and configured GitHub Pages to publish my site's source files from my master branch folder named Elegance. 
Publishing my source files is dependent on my site type as in what language the code is developed in and the site type I have in my repository.
To enable my GitHub Pages to be published, I have a master branch in my repository.
To access my GitHub Pages site's repository.
I access my repository name and click Settings.
Repository settings button
Use the Select source drop-down menu to select master or gh-pages as your GitHub Pages publishing source.
select-gh-pages-or-master-as-source
•	Click Save.
•	I then Published my GitHub Pages site from my docs folder in my master branch and published the source files from the docs folder in my master branch. I had to have a master branch containing all the data.
•	GitHub Pages reads everything when publishing a site, including the CNAME file, from the /docs folder. Every change is updated so every step taken and every edit is documented.
I used default commands to push to Github such as:
•	Used git status when checking what needed uploading.
•	I used the command -add git . to add to my git.
•	git commit -m "" with the named update between the quotes for anyone reading what changes I made. A short piece of info helps understand
•	the changes I make- I need to develop this area for next project.
•	git push -u origin master which then pushes my update and I then need to enter my username and password for security.
Issues whilst building the site
This issues I have had have been;
•	Telephone link
•	The cards – presenting them on different screens, spacing!
•	I have learnt a great deal on this project
•	Images from salon were delayed so many images were the older ones.
•	Testing
•	Initial testing identified telephone coding as an issue.
•	I tested the website Google Chrome and Safari. I was always using Google Chrome and found no issues when using this browser. 
The website worked to the normal standard on Mozilla Firefox as well. So far, So good. 
Media and Content
The text, images have been part of the marketing strategy and are still in development.
•	Some of the images have been taken from the old site, some from social media.
Code
•	I have used code from bootstap, web fundamentals and the code institute. 
•	HTML - All code produced by Matthew Lister except for the content such as videos and* images. These were searched and found on Google Chrome and then added into iframe and img source code which I had put together. The modal formats and forms were taken from my MS1 and edited to correspond to the needs of this website. I used script tags from Google Fonts to display the correct formatted fonts.

Acknowledgements
I would like to say thank you to my mentor.
The slack community for their passion in supporting me and others, I have realised how much you can learn from other challenges. 
Disclaimer
The content of the Website I have produced is for educational purposes at this stage yet with further development the salon may wish to use it.
How I’d like the website to be perceived:
•	“keep it simple, keep it specialized and make it purposeful” – I hope this is the users experience!
•	Rememberable
•	A site clients are happy to return to and use
