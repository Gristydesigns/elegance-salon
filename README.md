**ELEGANCE Hair Salon**

-   Elegance Hair salon is based in the market town of Ledbury; it has been running since 2011. The owner had previously commissioned a website designer to develop thier site; this site no longer fits the business aspirations. Ledbury is a developing small market town; the website needs to be interactive enabling customers in as little steps as possible to book online, call and buy products. This site to be interactive with Elegance’s social media sites and overall marketing strategy. The customer experience is important and needs to be quick and easy to use; we know statistically that we are spending less time on a site, scrolling onto next site unless engaged. The site needs to be connected with the appoitment site of the salon.
-   The website will attempt to answer the questions of the customer or direct them to gain the information they require.

**UX**

*Ideal customer:*

- customers using this site to purchase their hair products; this income generation is important to the salon.
- customers gaining inspiration from the showcase, wanting to try new designs,colourings

- wants more from their salon, an idividual experience
- 
Visiors to the Website:

- are looking for something different
- wanting to purchase JOICO products
- wanting to book when they are ready
- 
This projects helps them achive this through:

- links to the apointment website
- The website has been designed as part of a marketing strategy for the salon to gain new customers also, to offer customers to buy products.
- For customers unsure what they want to achieve to have the opportunity to look at what the salon offers; then gain opportunity for consultation.
- telephone link through to the salon
- links through to the productlinks through to other social media site where there are blogs and further information on products
- this website links with other social media, as we access different sites yet customers will be diverted to website
- other local websites have not updated their sites to offer these facilities
   -accomplishing this through a website that is engaging
   -informative yet not overpowering them with information
   -constaantly guiding them to seek a personal touch

*Client Stories:*

*  The main users are aged 18 and upwards however, their main client group is aged 40 plus.
*  Gaining a sense of trust with the owner and staff
*  to gain either a way to independently book appointments or to call through to the salon.
*  for the salon to have built on their reputation
*  for clients to know about the competions and training staff are attening and therefore want to try new designs, colourings

*  website not feel a barrier; to feel a tool and inspiring site.
*  The six-page website has been used as a market strategy element to get as much advertising space as organically as the salon can.
*  I want them to find the site practical, informative and inspiring. The website must give a clear element of professionalism and trust.
*  Separating the information on different pages allows the ease of information provided.
*  The user can book appointments at any time of the day through the website.
*  They can purchase products anytime of the day.

*Wireframe Mockups:*
-   Initially I drew my wireframe on paper. I worked out the template I wanted across all the pages. Then developed the ideas for the feature section, as a developer I want each section to be clear, informative and to draw viewer further to other parts of the site. As a developer I wanted the action buttons to be clear and user friendly so that they looked part of the page, subtle yet obvious.
-   I detailed my ideas and then reflected on these prior to using [balsamiq](NewProject%20elegance%20wireframe.pdf.bmpr) to have a digital version. I would use adobe XD next time as I feel this gives a better user experience for clients.
-   I already had some images as I have developed their ‘google my business’ site; in consideration for other projects I will be using imgbb.com site.
-   I also knew they were entering a competition so would have further images available yet were unsure what they would be like.

* [Wireframe1](https://imgbbb.com/image/LTLS6N)

* [Wireframe2](https://imgbbb.com/image/LTL0W7)

* [Wireframe3](https://imgbbb.com/image/LTL3oO)
* [wireframe4](https://ibb.co/N24mJrS)


-   The original wireframes had more images, and this could be a further development yet the images I had presently I have enclosed. The brightness and professional crisp finish. Some images provided I have not put on as they are outdated.
-   Having developed the first website and receiving feedback i developed [wireframe4](https://ibb.co/N24mJrS) this is the final project.

* From the original sketches my designs have developed. Using [balsamiq](NewProject%20elegance%20wireframe.pdf.bmpr) offered a digital version yet I would like to upgrade this next time as I feel it would enable me to grow my styles and add value to the project.

**Features**

The Navagation bar is fixed so that on every page it is available. this mean that on every section the customer can call the salon; reducing buttons over the website, focusing the customer on options.

This paragraph leads from the banner image to give some information on the salon and what is on offer. There is no images as the customer is focusing on the services. The stepdown paragraph has been developed to draw the customer into the words.

*About*

This section has an image and paragraph to update information on the salon and it's owner. giving the image and information to build on trust. Placing the image on the right.
The about section has been highlighted to give a seperation and emphasise to paragraph, to enable viewer to see seperation. The website is mainly on one page and offering seperation should enable viewers to categorise sections, as a developer i have assisted this through the colors.

*Prices*

This section cards were used, with images of the stylists on top. The layout to be simplistic and informative. The images supports the relationship between customer and stylist prior to appointmnet. The card allows a clear way of showing the prices and enabling the customer to compare and know what they are purchasing.
These cards have also been given a showdowing to them, to offer a distiction between the cards, the card set upi is to introduce the staffing team.

The action buttons at the bottom of each card are there to ensure efficent access to book online.
The images have been given a shadow to seperate each image to entice the client into the images seperately.

The contact information is on a seperate page to keep the front page focusing on the services being offered. Links on the contact page enable you to book online and there is a map available in this link.

*Products*

This page shows the products salon uses and that can be purchased. as a developer i wanted to offer a blog, so developed the format of two prodcuts to be showcased. the use of fontawesome scissors were used here. This page has been developed so that on a monthly basis new articles acn be shared.
The buttons take the viewer either through to salon landline or to purchase products.

The footer has links to the other social media sites for access through click. This is also access to afflicate link for JOICO products.
The buttons are highlighted, all buttons are same colour to offer viewer consistency through site. the curser finger is available so that customers have ease to click through.
The buy button has a grow fuction to draw attention, encouraging the viewer to click through.

**Project Design**

-   The website has been designed around the branding of the salon; they are in the process of developing this within their marketing strategy and the website is the centre of the launch. Keeping the website crisp and clean with call for action links has been the underpinning intention; key to the market strategy. The images have also been an important consideration as the salon has developed their knowledge and techniques and have not shared this formally; though imagery and showing off!

**Design**

-   My initial wireframe looked at a jumbotron which would be fixed at the top on all pages; yet as design started to develop this was changed. There is still at top call for action statement and button. As a developer my intentions were to show the knowledge and experience the salon can offer to customers and then with ease to contact them; through an action button. The salon has a good conversion rate, so the website is part of the traffic flow for the salon to increase clients.

**Colours**

-   The colour scheme was chosen by the owner yet there was some influence when I used the colour palette to have shades that complimented each other. We looked at 10 different colour palettes.
-   Originally a consideration was for a full background images; this was changed as what is needed is for the images to speak for themselves and have the impact they deserve.

**Images**

-   The salon is updating their images in-line with their new skills and abilities. So, the websites need to showcase these. Each image is there to inspire and show off the professionalism of the salon. As stated by their new strapline ’Setting the trend’; this has already been tested out as other salons are following Elegance strategies. Imagery is important to engage clients on site and so I need to as a developer place these well to have the wow factor, so they stay on site until they access the service.

**Styling**

-   Having researched other clean, crisps sites; demonstrated having consistency across all pages builds trust and knowledge for user to enable them to surf further on the site as it engages them. Designers appreciate that there is data that says it is harder to engage users on your sit year by year we flick less; therefore, it is paramount users have an experience they are enjoying; gaining what they require swiftly.
-   Location information has been offered through a link; maps can be distracting on a page.
-   The hover option is on all buttons for ease for the user knowing where they are on the site. Hight-light of text has been offered to draw their focus subtly to the full page. Links to FaceBook, Instagram are working to enable them to link further if required.
-   The home page has been designed so that when the salon develops Blogs on their ‘Google My Business’ and this can be linked through offering consistency and branding/promotion.

**Fonts**

-   As a developer I want to find text that would work across browsers. I used Google fonts to find a font that would complement their logo which is in baldessare font. The salon is presently updating so they will have an image file for their logo, and this will need to be added at a later date.
-   Fonts and colour of the website I tested out the with owner and customer group.

*Exsisting Features*
 - Header logo is fixed on every section and takes you to home page. This is where the brand of the company is recognisable. Clicking the logo takes you back to home section.
 - Navigation Bar is available on each section.
 - Footer contains the copyright information.
 - social icons are avialble in the footer section.
 

**Future plans**

-   Future plans would be adding FB likes links in the footer.
-   To add FB pixel so that through google analytics can provide further information on statistic on site; this will enable the marketing strategy to continually develop and transform the salon. The website is key to this.
-   Google analytics is the next part of the market strategy and will inform future developments. Adding links to action buttons on site will inform future changes.
-   Speed of the website and images ass this important for user experience especially on mobiles.

**Deployment**

* This project was developed using AWS Cloud9. The data is stored in git using the AWS Cloud9 platform.

* The project was regularly pushed to GitHub repository [https://gristydesigns.github.io/elegance-salon/](https://gristydesigns.github.io/elegance-salon/) and published to GitHub pages using the GitHub settings.

**Deployment to Github**

* I used and configured GitHub Pages to publish my site's source files from my master branch folder named Elegance.

* Publishing my source files is dependent on my site type as in what language the code is developed in and the site type I have in my repository.

* To enable my GitHub Pages to be published, I have a master branch in my repository.

* To access my GitHub Pages site's repository.

* I access my repository name and click Settings.

* Repository settings button

* Use the Select source drop-down menu to select master or gh-pages as your GitHub Pages publishing source.

* select-gh-pages-or-master-as-source

-   Click Save.
-   I then Published my GitHub Pages site from my docs folder in my master branch and published the source files from the docs folder in my master branch. I had to have a master branch containing all the data.

I used default commands to push to Github such as:

-   Used git status when checking what needed uploading.
-   I used the command -add git . to add to my git.
-   git commit -m "" with the named update between the quotes for anyone reading what changes I made. A short piece of info helps understand
-   the changes I make- I need to develop this area for next project.
-   git push -u origin master which then pushes my update and I then need to enter my username and password for security.

**Issues whilst building the site**

The issues have been;

* Telephone link

* The cards – presenting them on different screens, spacing!

* I have learnt a great deal on this project

* Images from salon were delayed so many images were the older ones.

-   **Testing**

-   Initial testing identified telephone coding as an issue.
-   I tested the website Google Chrome and Safari. I was always using Google Chrome and found no issues when using this browser.

* The website worked to the normal standard on Mozilla Firefox as well. So far, So good.

**Media and Content**

* The text, images have been part of the marketing strategy and are still in development.

-   Some of the images have been taken from the old site, some from social media.

**Code**

-   I have used code from bootstap, web fundamentals and the code institute.
-   HTML - All code produced by Matthew Lister except for the content such as videos and* images. These were searched and found on Google Chrome and then added into iframe and img source code which I had put together. The modal formats and forms were taken from my MS1 and edited to correspond to the needs of this website. I used script tags from Google Fonts to display the correct formatted fonts.

**Acknowledgements**

* I would like to say thank you to my mentor.

* The slack community for their passion in supporting me and others, I have realised how much you can learn from other challenges.

**Disclaimer**

The content of the Website I have produced is for educational purposes at this stage yet with further development the salon may wish to use it.

**How I’d like the website to be perceived:**

* “keep it simple, keep it specialized and make it purposeful” – I hope this is the users experience!

* Remembered

* A site clients are happy to return to and use
