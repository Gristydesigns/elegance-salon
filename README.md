#ELEGANCE Hair Salon

-   Elegance Hair salon is based in the market town of Ledbury; it has been running since 2011. The owner had previously commissioned a website designer to develop thier site; this site no longer fits the business aspirations. Ledbury is a developing small market town; the website needs to be interactive enabling customers in as little steps as possible to book online, call and buy products. This site to be interactive with Elegance’s social media sites and overall marketing strategy. The customer experience is important and needs to be quick and easy to use; we know statistically that we are spending less time on a site, scrolling onto next site unless engaged. The site needs to be connected with the appoitment site of the salon.
-   The website will attempt to answer the questions of the customer or direct them to gain the information they require.
-   Developing the new Branding of the Salon

###UX

###Ideal customer:

- Customers using this site to purchase their hair products; this income generation is important to the salon.
- Customers gaining inspiration from the Gallery, wanting to try new designs, colourings, products.
- Lives or stays regularly in Ledbury.
- Wants more from their salon, an idividual experience.
- 
##Visiors to the Website:

- Are looking for a local salon.
- Are looking for a unique experience.
- Wanting to purchase JOICO products.
- Wanting to book when they are ready, available 24 hours.

##This projects helps them achive this through:

- Links to the Salon's appointment website
- The website has been designed as part of a marketing strategy for the salon to gain new customers, to offer customers to buy products; availability to write weekly blogs.
- For customers unsure what they want to achieve to have the opportunity to look at what the salon offers; then gain opportunity for consultation.
- Telephone link through to the salon' one click to talk with salon.
- Links through to the productlinks through to other social media site where there are blogs and further information on products.
- This website links with other social media, as we access different sites yet customers will be diverted to website.
- Other local websites have not updated their sites to offer these facilities.
- Accomplishing this through a website that is engaging.
- Informative yet not overpowering them with information.
- Constantly guiding them to seek a personal touch.

###Client Stories:

*  The main users are aged 18 and upwards however, their main client group is aged 40 plus.
*  Gaining a sense of trust with the owner and stylists.
*  To gain either a way to independently book appointments or to call through to the salon.
*  For the salon to build on their reputation, by having a website that offers more.
*  For clients to know about the competions and training staff are attending and therefore want to try new designs, colourings; this completed through blogs; product page.

*  Website not to feel a barrier; to feel a tool and inspiring site.
*  I want the client to find the site practical, informative and inspiring. The website must give a clear element of professionalism and trust.
*  Separating the information on different pages allows the ease of information provided.
*  The user can book appointments at any time of the day through the website.
*  They can purchase products anytime of the day, salon can introduce new products.

###Wireframe Mockups:
-   Initially I drew my wireframe on paper. I worked out the template I wanted across all the pages. Then developed the ideas for the feature section, as a developer I want each section to be clear, informative and to draw viewer further to other parts of the site. As a developer I wanted the 'call to action' buttons to be clear and user friendly so that they looked part of the page, subtle yet obvious.
-   I detailed my ideas and then reflected on these prior to using [balsamiq](NewProject%20elegance%20wireframe.pdf.bmpr) to have a digital version. I would use adobe XD next time as I feel this gives a better user experience for clients.
-   I already had some images as I have developed their ‘google my business’ site; in consideration for other projects.
-   I also knew they were entering a competition so would have further images available yet were unsure when they will be available.

* [Wireframe1](https://imgbbb.com/image/LTLS6N)

* [Wireframe2](https://imgbbb.com/image/LTL0W7)

* [Wireframe3](https://imgbbb.com/image/LTL3oO)

* [wireframe4](https://ibb.co/N24mJrS)


-   The original wireframes had more images, and this could be a further development yet the images I had presently I have enclosed. The brightness and professional crisp finish. Some images provided I have not put on as they are outdated.
-   Having developed the first website and receiving feedback i developed [wireframe4](https://ibb.co/N24mJrS) this is the final project.
-   From the original sketches my designs have developed. Using [Balsamiq](NewProject%20elegance%20wireframe.pdf.bmpr) offered a digital version yet I would like to upgrade this next time as I feel it would enable me to grow my styles and add value to the project.

Keeping the website crisp and clean with call for action links has been the underpinning intention; key to the market strategy.

##Issues whilst building the site

*The issues have been;

- Telephone link- I started looking at the fundermental [Web](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/native-hardware/click-to-call/) page; looking for a way to link through from website to Salon; the information out there is varied. With further guidance the links worked through popperjs.

- Working my way through sites to find up to date information when issues arose through coding e.g gallery configuration. as a student it is having the right tools and web links to make this efficent; i am gaining these.

- Designing the first website with 6 pages and then deciding through design that the website needing to be overhauled and started from scratch. the process of learning and working out how best to deliver the site to meet the needs.
- Images from salon were delayed so many images were the older ones.
- Balsamiq wireframe was not flexible and would use another system next time.

###Testing

-   [Find unclosed tags](https://aliciaramirez.com/closing-tags-checker/) was used to verify correct tags.
-   [W3S validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea) to ensure code has no errors.
-   Initial testing identified telephone coding as an issue.
-   I tested the website Google Chrome and Safari. I was always using Google Chrome and found no issues when using this browser.
-   The website worked to the normal standard on Mozilla Firefox as well. So far, so good.

##Media and Content

- The text, images have been part of the marketing strategy and are still in development.

- Some of the images have been taken from the old site, some from social media.
